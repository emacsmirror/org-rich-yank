# [[https://melpa.org/#/org-rich-paste][https://melpa.org/packages/org-rich-paste-badge.svg]]

Do you often yank source code into your org files, manually
surrounding it in =#+BEGIN_SRC= blocks? This package will give you a
new way of pasting that automatically surrounds the snippet in blocks,
marked with the major mode of where the code came from, and adds a
link to the source file after the block.
